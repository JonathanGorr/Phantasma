# Phantasma
Phantasma is a 2d Beat-Em Up for PC, developed in Unity3d in 2015.
The game was my senior-year thesis at MICA.

The game is about a young boy on a quest to save his mum from bandits!
Phantasma (game) is a work in progress.

Phantasma does not currently have keyboard+Mouse controls;
Please use an xbox or ps4 controller.
